## Scenario
A Day in the Life of Ava
Morning
Ava sits down with her morning coffee, scrolling through her banking app. A notification pops up: “Your monthly statement is ready.” She opens it and frowns at the balance. Where did all that money go this month?
She glances at her desk, where a small sticky note reads: “Save $500 for vacation.” Ava had meant to put aside something each week but now isn’t sure how much progress she’s made.
 
Late Morning
At work, Ava’s coworker shares their excitement about hitting a savings milestone. “I started tracking my spending and set weekly savings goals,” they explain. Ava nods, thinking that she should try something similar. But she quickly pushes the thought aside, distracted by emails piling up in her inbox.
 
Lunch
While grabbing lunch at a café, Ava wonders if she’s overspending on eating out. She remembers thinking the same thing last month but never did anything about it. “It’d be nice to know how much I actually spend on this stuff,” she thinks, looking at her receipt.
She jots down a quick note: “Track spending categories.”
 
Afternoon
After work, Ava swings by the mall to pick up a gift for a friend. On impulse, she buys a new pair of shoes that weren’t exactly in her budget.
As she walks out, she thinks about her vacation fund again. “I really need to track my savings better,” she mutters.
 
Evening
Back home, Ava flips through her bank statements, trying to figure out how much she saved this month. The process feels tedious, and the numbers aren’t adding up the way she hoped. “I need something simple to keep track of this,” she says, closing the laptop in frustration.
